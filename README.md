### Oh-my-zsh plugins

Syntax-highlighting and autosuggestions are two must haves.

git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting

git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions

#Add plugins in ~/.zshrc:

vim ./.zshrc

plugins=(git zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions)

#Reload zshrc configuration
source ./.zshrc

```

## For China Mainland Users:

### Clash is now a better choice on Linux than qv2ray or other proxy apps
We recommand you to use clash-for-windows(cfw) linux version, cfw was originally built for windows, but now it has macOS and linux distros.

Search `clash for windows` in GitHub then download its linux version.

Extract the tar.gz file to you home directory, we recommand that rename it as clash for convenience.

Run the file named `cfw`, you will see the GUI. Go to Profiles tab, paste the link that your V2Ray or SS service providers offerd, then click download.

To autostart CFW, activate start with linux option in its dashborad.

We recommend using CFW as global proxy.

For desktop apps, set proxy in sysytem setting.

Set CFW as proxy for terminal:

```shell
export https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890;export http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890;export all_proxy=socks5://127.0.0.1:7890
```

### WeChat

Or you can follow the steps blew:

```
wget -O- https://deepin-wine.i-m.dev/setup.sh | sh
sudo apt-get install com.qq.weixin.deepin

## After installation, you need to upscale your wechat inorder to fit your 2k or 4k screen
cd /opt/apps/com.qq.weixin.deepin/entries/applications
sudo vim com.qq.weixin.deepin.desktop      

```

ADD `env DEEPIN_WINE_SCALE=2` 

```

### Setup proxy for git
You can skip these part if you've set CFW as global proxy for terminal and desktop apps.

Sometimes connections to github could be unstable, use proxy for git to make it more in control.

**Git through SSH**
```
cd ./.ssh
vim config
```
Add these content to `config` file
```
Host github.com
        User    git
        Hostname        github.com
        Port    22
        Proxycommand    /usr/bin/ncat --proxy 127.0.0.1:7890 --proxy-type socks5 %h %p
```
If you are not using clash, replace `7890` with the port your proxy tool are using.

**Git through HTTP/HHTPS**
```shell
git config --global http.proxy 'socks5://127.0.0.1:1081'
git config --global https.proxy 'socks5://127.0.0.1:1081'
```
## goldendict
Taking English-SimplifiedChinese translation case as exmaple here.

Add online dictionart like this:
`https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/%GDWORD%`

Make sure you don't use GoldenDict as UserAgent when access online dictionary.

To add an offline dictionary, we recommenda to make a directory under `./.goldendict` called `dicts`. A ch-en dictinary is in `files` folder already, you can use that.
