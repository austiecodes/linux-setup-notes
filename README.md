### For China mainland users, Clash is now a better choice on Linux than qv2ray or other proxy apps
We recommand you to use clash-for-windows(cfw) linux version, cfw was originally built for windows, but now it has macOS and linux distros.

Search `clash for windows` in GitHub then download its linux version.

Extract the tar.gz file to you home directory, we recommand that rename it as clash for convenience.

Run the file named `cfw`, you will see the GUI. Go to Profiles tab, paste the link that your V2Ray or SS service providers offerd, then click download.

To autostart CFW, activate start with linux option in its dashborad.
